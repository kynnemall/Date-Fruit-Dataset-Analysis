    "# Date Fruit Dataset - Analysis and Model Training\n",
    "This dataset comes from a paper (reference below) which extracted features from 898 images of 7 different Date species in an effort ot classify them using Logistic Regression and Artificial Neural Networks, which yielded classification accuracies of 91.0% and 92.2%, respectively. Stacking the models yielded a slight increase in accuracy (92.8%).\n",
    "\n",
    "In `1-analysis.ipynb`, we examined the data to select, transform, and scale features for model training. Using these data, we will now fit machine learning algorithms and measure their performance.\n",

    "As a non-linear technique, Random Forest models generally learn to fit the data quite well, as evidenced by the comparable accuracy for each dataset. Using all the raw data without transformation (blue) appears to be the best model, but the overlap in histograms and standard deviation between the models indicates that any of these models will suffice.\n",

    "While Random Forests are a powerful ensemble technique, they are prone to overfitting and are less straightforward to interpret than a Logistic Regression model. Let's therefore proceed to tune the hyperparameters of a Logistic Regression model using the transformed subset of features to see if we can optimize the performance any further."

Testing different solvers resulted in failed convergence in many cases and no improvement over the baseline scores. Thus, the best approach is to try again with a more involved approach to feature selection which should aim to beat our new baseline accuracy of 83.5±6.2%"
