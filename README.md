# Date-Fruit-Dataset-Analysis

This project utilized the Date Fruit Dataset provided on Kaggle in relation to this research paper:

KOKLU, M., KURSUN, R., TASPINAR, Y. S., and CINAR, I. (2021). Classification of Date Fruits into Genetic Varieties Using Image Analysis. Mathematical Problems in Engineering, Vol.2021, Article ID: 4793293, DOI:10.1155/2021/4793293

### Running the analysis
In the Jupyter notebook `1-analysis.ipynb`, you will find all of the exploratory data analyses I ran and considered for the base dataset (provided in the `Date_Fruit_Datasets` folder), as well as feature selection and transformations to be applied to the data to enable certain models.

In the `2-training.ipynb` notebook, you will find the models tested on these datasets and a comparison of their performances. I also played around with the `yellobrick` library for visualizing model performance and classification accuracies.
